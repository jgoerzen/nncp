archive on the fly.

@item
Free disk space is checked during outbound packets creation.

@item
@option{freq}, @option{freqminsize}, @option{freqchunked} configuration
file options replaced with the structure:
@option{freq: @{path: ..., minsize: ..., chunked: ...@}}.

@node Release 5.0.0
@section Release 5.0.0
@itemize

@item
@strong{Incompatible} configuration file format change: YAML is
replaced with Hjson, due to its simplicity, without noticeable lack
of either functionality or convenience.

@item
@strong{Incompatible} plain packet format changes. Older versions are
not supported. @code{zlib} compression is replaced with
@code{Zstandard}, due to its speed and efficiency, despite library
version is not mature enough.

@item
Ability to call remote nodes via pipe call of external command, not only
through TCP.

@item
@command{nncp-cfgnew} generates configuration file with many
comments. @option{-nocomments} option can be used for an old
behaviour.

@item
Duplicate filenames have @file{.CTR} suffix, instead of @file{CTR}, to
avoid possible collisions with @file{.nncp.chunkCTR}.

@item
Ability to override process umask through configuration file option.

@item
Files and directories are created with 666/777 permissions by default,
allowing control with @command{umask}.

@item
Updated dependencies.

@item
Full usage of go modules for dependencies management
(@code{go.cypherpunks.ru/nncp/v5} namespace is used).

@item
Forbid any later GNU GPL version autousage
(project's licence now is GNU GPLv3-only).

@node Release 4.1
@section Release 4.1
@itemize
@item Workability on GNU/Linux systems and Go 1.10 is fixed.
@end itemize

@node Release 4.0
@section Release 4.0
@itemize

@item
@strong{Incompatible} encrypted and eblob packet format change: AEAD
encryption mode with 128 KiB blocks is used now, because previously
@command{nncp-toss} did not verify encrypted packet's MAC before feeding
decrypted data to external command. Older versions are not supported.

@item
Available free space checking before copying in @command{nncp-xfer},
@command{nncp-daemon}, @command{nncp-call(er)}.

@item
@command{nncp-call} has ability only to list packets on remote node,
without their transmission.

@item
@command{nncp-call} has ability to transfer only specified packets.

@item
Workability of @option{xxrate} preference in @option{calls}
configuration file section.

@item
Dependant libraries are updated.

@item
Minor bugfixes.

@item
Begin using of @code{go.mod} subsystem.

@node Release 3.4
@section Release 3.4
@itemize
@item @command{nncp-daemon} can be run as @command{inetd}-service.
@end itemize

@node Release 3.3
@section Release 3.3
@itemize

@item
@command{nncp-daemon}, @command{nncp-call}, @command{nncp-caller} check
if @file{.seen} exists and treat it like file was already downloaded.
Possibly it was transferred out-of-bound and remote side needs to be
notifier about that.

@item
If higher priority packet is spooled, then @command{nncp-daemon} will
queue its sending first, interrupting lower priority transmissions.

@item
Simple packet rate limiter added to online-related tools
(@command{nncp-daemon}, @command{nncp-call}, @command{nncp-caller}).

@item
Ability to specify niceness with symbolic notation:
@verb{|NORMAL|}, @verb{|BULK+10|}, @verb{|PRIORITY-5|}, etc.

@item
Changed default niceness levels:
for @command{nncp-exec} from 64 to 96,
for @command{nncp-freq} from 64 to 160,
for @command{nncp-file} from 196 to 224.

@end itemize

@node Release 3.2
@section Release 3.2
@itemize
@item
@strong{Incompatible} @emph{bundle} archive format changes and
@command{nncp-bundle} workability with Go 1.10+. Bundles must be
valid tar archives, but Go 1.9 made them invalid because of long paths
inside. NNCP accidentally was dependant on that bug. Explicit adding of
@file{NNCP/} directory in archive restores workability with valid tar
archives.
@end itemize

@node Release 3.1

@itemize
@item
Ability to disable relaying at all using @verb{|-via -|} command line option.

@node Release 3.0
@section Release 3.0
@itemize

@item
@strong{Incompatible} plain packet format changes. Older versions are
not supported.

@item
Ability to queue remote command execution, by configuring @option{exec}
option in configuration file and using @command{nncp-exec} command:
    @itemize
    @item
    @command{nncp-mail} command is replaced with more flexible
    @command{nncp-exec}. Instead of @verb{|nncp-mail NODE RECIPIENT|}
    you must use @verb{|nncp-exec NODE sendmail RECIPIENT|}.
    @item
    @option{sendmail} configuration file option is replaced with
    @option{exec}. @verb{|sendmail: [...]|} must be replaced with
    @verb{|exec: sendmail: [...]|}.
    @end itemize

@item
Ability to override @option{via} configuration option for destination
node via @option{-via} command line option for following commands:
@command{nncp-file}, @command{nncp-freq}, @command{nncp-exec}.

@item
Chunked files, having size less than specified chunk size, will be sent
as an ordinary single file.

@item
Exec commands are invoked with additional @env{NNCP_NICE} and
@env{NNCP_SELF} environment variables.

@item
Files, that are sent as a reply to freq, have niceness level taken from
the freq packet. You can set desired niceness during @command{nncp-freq}
invocation using @option{-replynice} option.

@item
@command{nncp-toss} command can ignore specified packet types during
processing: @option{-nofile}, @option{-nofreq}, @option{-noexec},
@option{-notrns}.

@item
@command{nncp-file} command uses
@option{FreqMinSize}/@option{FreqChunked} configuration file options
for @option{-minsize}/@option{-chunked} by default. You can turn this
off by specifying zero value.

@node Release 2.0
@section Release 2.0
@itemize

@item
@strong{Incompatible} encrypted/eblob packet format changes. Older
versions are not supported.

@item
Twofish encryption algorithm is replaced with ChaCha20. It is much more
faster. One cryptographic primitive less.

@item
HKDF-BLAKE2b-256 KDF algorithm is replaced with BLAKE2Xb XOF. Yet
another cryptographic primitive less (assuming that BLAKE2X is nearly
identical to BLAKE2).

@node Release 1.0
@section Release 1.0
@itemize

@item
@strong{Incompatible} encrypted packet format changes. Older versions
are not supported.

@item
@command{nncp-bundle} command can either create stream of encrypted
packets, or digest it. It is useful when dealing with stdin/stdout based
transmission methods (like writing to CD-ROM without intermediate
prepared ISO image and working with tape drives).

@item
@command{nncp-toss} is able to create @file{.seen} files preventing
duplicate packets receiving.

@item
Single background checksum verifier worker is allowed in
@command{nncp-call}. This is helpful when thousands of small inbound
packets could create many goroutines.

@item
Ability to override path to spool directory and logfile through either
command line argument, or environment variable.

@item
@command{nncp-rm} is able to delete outbound/inbound, @file{.seen},
@file{.part}, @file{.lock} and temporary files.

Little bugfix in @command{nncp-file} command, where @option{-minsize}
option for unchunked transfer was not in KiBs, but in bytes.
@end itemize

@node Release 0.7
@section Release 0.7
@itemize

@item
Ability to feed @command{nncp-file} from stdin, that uses an encrypted
temporary file for that.

@item
Chunked files transmission appeared with corresponding
@command{nncp-reass} command and @option{freqchunked} configuration file
entry. Useful for transferring big files over small storage devices.

@item
@option{freqminsize} configuration file option, analogue to
@option{-minsize} one.

@item
@command{nncp-xfer}'s @option{-force} option is renamed to
@option{-mkdir} for clarity.

@item
@option{-minsize} option is specified in KiBs, not bytes, for
convenience.

@item
@command{nncp-newcfg} command is renamed to @command{nncp-cfgnew},
and @command{nncp-mincfg} to @command{nncp-cfgmin} -- now they have
common prefix and are grouped together for convenience.

@item
@command{nncp-cfgenc} command appeared, allowing configuration file
encryption/decryption, for keeping it safe without any either OpenPGP or
similar tools usage.

@item
Cryptographic libraries (dependencies) are updated.

@end itemize

@node Release 0.4
@section Release 0.4
@itemize

@item
Small fix in @command{nncp-call}, @command{nncp-caller},
@command{nncp-daemon}: they can segmentation fail sometimes (no data is
lost).

@item
@command{nncp-newnode} renamed to @command{nncp-newcfg} -- it is shorter
and more convenient to use.

@item
@command{nncp-mincfg} command appeared: helper allowing to create
minimalistic stripped down configuration file without private keys, that
is useful during @command{nncp-xfer} usage.

@end itemize
