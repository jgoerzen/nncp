Possibly NNCP package already exists for your distribution:

@itemize
@item @url{https://www.freshports.org/net/nncp/, FreeBSD ports}
@item @url{https://github.com/DragonFlyBSD/DPorts/tree/master/net/nncp, DragonFly BSD ports}
@item @url{https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/nncp/template, Void Linux}
@end itemize

NNCP should run on any POSIX-compatible operating system.

NNCP is written on @url{https://golang.org/, Go} programming language
and you have to install Go compiler 1.10+ version. @command{Make} (BSD
and GNU versions are fine) is recommended for convenient building.
@url{https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/, Texinfo} is used for
building documentation (although tarballs already include it).

In general you must get @ref{Tarballs, the tarball}, check its
@ref{Integrity, integrity and authenticity} and run @command{make}.
Look for general and platform-specific @ref{Build-instructions, build
instructions}.

@menu
* Prepared tarballs: Tarballs.
* Tarballs integrity check: Integrity.
* Build instructions: Build-instructions.
* Development source code: Sources.
